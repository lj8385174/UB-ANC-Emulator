# UB-ANC Emulator
An Emulation Framework for Multi-Agent Drone Networks

Build
--------------

There are three main steps to build UB-ANC Emulator:

1) build ArduCopter Software in the Loop (SITL):
  - http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/setting-up-sitl-on-linux.html

2) build APM Planner 
  - https://github.com/ArduPilot/apm_planner

3) build UB-ANC Emulator

```
git clone https://github.com/jmodares/UB-ANC-Emulator
mkdir build-emulator
cd build-emulator
qmake ../UB-ANC-Emulator
make -j4
```

Configuration
-------------

In order to configure firmware, run the APM Planner, and make a TCP connection to firmware, and change these parameters:
  - SYSID_THISMAV
  - ARMING_CHECK

For configuring UB-ANC Emulator, follow the steps below:

```
mkdir objects
cp path_to_ArduCopter.elf_and_eeprom.bin objects/your_drone_name/firmware_and_eeprom.bin
cp path_to_agent objects/your_drone_name/agent
```

Each port represents an agent, starting from 5763, 5773, etc.
